# Linear Regression on Housing Prices

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features of the properties. The real estate market is highly dynamic, and accurate price predictions can significantly benefit buyers, sellers, and investors.

### Objectives

- To analyze the relationship between housing prices and various influencing factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities.
- To create a robust linear regression model that can provide accurate price predictions based on the input features.
- To evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and contains historical housing data with features such as:

- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Location and neighborhood information
- Year built
- Additional features like parking and garden space

### Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the relationships between features and housing prices.
   - Identify correlations and insights to inform feature selection.

3. **Train-Test Split:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

4. **Model Development:**
   - Train a linear regression model using the training dataset.
   - Optimize model parameters and validate using cross-validation techniques.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R-squared.
   - Analyze residuals to check for patterns and improve model accuracy.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Results

The linear regression model provides insights into the factors affecting housing prices and achieves satisfactory prediction accuracy. The results highlight the most significant features influencing price variations.
